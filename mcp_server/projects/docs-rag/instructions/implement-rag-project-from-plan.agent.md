- Use RAG system to answer questions about current project implementation requirements
- Create implementation plan in `docs/implementation-tasklist.md` with detailed steps
- Add all implementation phases to task list using `todos` tool 
- Implement project step by step in current workspace root directory
- Conduct all chat communication in Russian language
- Ask RAG system questions in English for better retrieval accuracy
- Create all files and code in English language
- Use `lng_llm_rag_search` with appropriate prompt templates:
  + `project_analysis` for general project questions
  + `critical_analysis` for architectural compliance checks
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, testable components
- Each step should produce testable output: terminal commands, unit tests, or demos
- Wait for approval before proceeding to next implementation phase
- Query RAG system frequently to ensure compliance with documented requirements
- Use retrieved context to guide implementation decisions and validate approaches
